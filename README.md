# NorthwoodExtra
NorthwoodExtra is a web application that utilizes a back-end database server that contains information regarding Northwood High Schoolâ€™s catalog of classes and clubs. This information was taken from the NHS Program of Studies 2022-23 (UPDATED) and the NHS Club Directory 2020-2021 respectively.  The programming languages used follow the standard requirement for a full-stack web application, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL.  NorthwoodExtra was built by an NHS student to provide all students, both incoming and current, with a simple way to explore the vast selection of NHS classes and clubs.
